Introduction:

The purpose of the What's In a Doctor's Bag game is to educate people, especially and particularly young children, about what goes on at a doctorâ€™s visit. As a result, we hope to eliminate any fear experienced by children when they visit the doctor. The development of this game was requested by Dr. Neil Shulman, a doctor at Emory University. Moreover, the interactive game strives to mimic Dr. Shulman's What's In a Doctor's Bag book. Currently, no other project exists that is similar or has the same objectives.

The source, requirements documentation, and design and test documentation is included.
